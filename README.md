ConstructionLendPro Technical Implementation Documentation

## System Architecture Overview

ConstructionLendPro implements a cloud-native microservices architecture designed specifically for construction loan management. The system leverages AWS infrastructure to provide scalability, reliability, and security while maintaining loose coupling between components.

### High-Level Architecture

The system architecture consists of several interconnected layers, each serving distinct purposes in the construction loan lifecycle:

The architecture diagram illustrates the system's layered approach:

- The Client Layer provides a unified interface through React Single-spa microfrontend framework
- API Gateway acts as the entry point, routing requests to appropriate services
- Core Services handle business logic independently but coordinate through EventBridge
- Event Processing Layer enables asynchronous communication and system extensibility
- Infrastructure Layer provides persistence, caching, and storage capabilities
